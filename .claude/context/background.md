### Logistics

We will all be flying into and out of Athens, so that is where the trip will start and end.

We are willing to take trains, ships, ferries, planes, rental cars, or taxis to travel between locations. That said, we would like to minimize our pure "travel" time within the main duration of the vacation.

### Vacation Party

This vacation party is made up of 3 couples. You can find information about them in `./resources/parties/`.

### Activity Preferences

Each individual party has preferences in their corresponding `./resources/parties/` file. Global group preferences are in `./resources/global-preferences.md`.
