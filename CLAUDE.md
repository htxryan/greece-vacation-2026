# Greece Vacation

We are planning a family vacation to Greece for October 2026 -- 12 days (+2 travel days).

## Vacation Background Info

### Vacation Party

This vacation party is made up of 3 couples. You can find information about them in `./resources/parties/`.

### Activity Preferences

Each individual party has preferences in their corresponding `./resources/parties/` file. Global group preferences are in `./resources/global-preferences.md`.

### High-Level Plan

For this vacation, we want to do something together for the first few days (we're flying into Athens), then go independently for the rest of the trip, maybe ending with a few days in the same place (but maybe not if the logistics don't work out).

Travis and Donna are traveling with her family for the duration of the trip, and they will go off separately after the initial together portion. DO NOT worry about planning for their trip after the initial together portion, they want to plan it themselves.

## Research Organization

Before we decide on a final itinerary, we want to organize extensive research on our options. Below is the layout of how research should be organized.

- ./research/locations/<location-1-name>/location-overview.md (using template `./.claude/templates/location-overview.md`)
- ./research/locations/<location-name>/activities/<activity-1-name>.md (using template `./.claude/templates/activity-overview.md`)
- ./research/locations/<location-name>/activities/<activity-2-name>.md (using template `./.claude/templates/activity-overview.md`)
- ...

## Publishing (Sharing with Family)

We want to share ALL our research and findings with the whole family (contributing research, suggested itineraries, and any other notes).

To do this, we've set up a GitHub Pages site for this repo: `https://htxryan.github.io/greece-vacation-2026`.
