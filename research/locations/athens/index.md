# Athens

Athens is where your Greece adventure begins and ends. As the capital and largest city of Greece, Athens blends nearly 3,500 years of history with modern European vibrancy. The city is dominated by the iconic Acropolis, crowned by the Parthenon, visible from almost anywhere in the historic center. Beyond the ancient ruins, Athens offers world-class museums, charming pedestrian neighborhoods, excellent food, and a thriving café culture perfect for people-watching.

October is considered one of the best times to visit Athens. Daytime temperatures hover around 22°C (72°F), dropping to a pleasant 14°C (57°F) at night. You'll enjoy about 7 hours of sunshine daily, minimal crowds compared to summer, and hotel prices up to 60% lower than peak season. The city comes alive with events like the Athens International Film Festival and the grape harvest season—perfect for wine tastings.

## Who This is For

**Everyone in the group** will find something to love in Athens:

- **Andy & Kathy**: Athens is the departure point for excellent Saronic Islands day cruises to Hydra, Poros, and Aegina—perfect for cruise lovers. The city's pedestrian-friendly historic center offers easy walking and plenty of café stops.

- **Ryan & Toni**: Athens has Greece's finest concentration of Michelin-starred restaurants, including Delta (2 stars) and eight 1-star establishments. The city offers incredible photography opportunities—from the illuminated Acropolis at night to the island-like streets of Anafiotika. Food tours through the Central Market are outstanding. Note: Toni has visited Athens before, but all the other travelers will be experiencing it for the first time. Ryan will enjoy the museums (Acropolis Museum, National Archaeological Museum) while Toni prefers to limit museum time—a good balance is the Acropolis Museum which combines stunning views with concise historical context.

- **Donna & Travis**: Historic sites galore without exhausting hikes, vibrant nightlife in Psyrri and Gazi, and excellent street food scene. Note: For Donna's Spanish-speaking family members (including two women in their 80s), Athens offers Spanish-language tours at major sites and a flexible, low-key exploration style—wandering Plaka's cafés and people-watching at Monastiraki Square fits well with their preference for avoiding rigid schedules.

## Reasons to Choose
