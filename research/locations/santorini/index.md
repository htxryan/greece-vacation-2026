# Santorini

Santorini (also known as Thira) is one of Greece's most iconic islands, famous for its dramatic caldera views, whitewashed buildings with blue-domed churches, stunning sunsets, and unique volcanic landscape. Formed by a massive volcanic eruption around 1600 BC, the crescent-shaped island offers breathtaking cliffside villages, volcanic beaches, world-class wine, and rich ancient history.
