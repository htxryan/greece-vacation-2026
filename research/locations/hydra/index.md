# Hydra

Hydra is a charming, car-free Greek island in the Saronic Gulf, just 1.5-2 hours by ferry from Athens. Famous for its picturesque harbor lined with 18th-century stone mansions, the island has a timeless quality where donkeys replace cars and the pace of life slows to a gentle rhythm. The island has long attracted artists, writers, and celebrities—from Leonard Cohen who lived here in the 1960s to Picasso and The Rolling Stones.

## Who This is For

**All three couples** would enjoy Hydra, making it an excellent option for the "together" portion of the trip:

- **Andy and Kathy**: The relaxed atmosphere and easy ferry access from Athens make it cruise-like without the hassle. The harbor cafés are perfect for people-watching, and getting around by foot or water taxi eliminates any driving stress.

- **Ryan and Toni**: Exceptional photography opportunities at every turn—the harbor at sunrise, donkeys carrying goods through narrow lanes, whitewashed buildings against blue water. Several upscale dining options (Omilos, Téchnē, Mikra Anglia) offer the fine dining experience they enjoy, while traditional tavernas like Xeri Elia (Douskos) provide authentic local favorites. The swimming spots like Spilia offer clear blue water typical of the Saronic Gulf. **This is a new destination for Toni** (not one of her previous Greece visits), offering fresh exploration. Note: The island has minimal museums, which works well for Toni's preference—instead, the experience is about atmosphere, dining, and photography.

- **Donna and Travis**: The bohemian vibe, swimming spots, and Leonard Cohen heritage add cultural depth. Easy day trip from Athens if time is limited. **Note for Donna's family**: While the car-free atmosphere is peaceful, the island does require walking—some paths are uneven or hilly. For family members with mobility concerns (the two women in their 80s), the harbor area is mostly flat and offers the best people-watching, dining, and atmosphere without requiring extensive walking. Water taxis can help reach beaches without climbing. The lack of schedules and leisurely café culture fits their preference for flexibility.

## Details

### Suggested Time
1-2 full days is ideal. Can be done as a day trip from Athens, but an overnight stay allows for a more relaxed experience, sunset drinks, and morning harbor exploration.

### Best for October 2026
October is excellent timing—warm enough for swimming (sea temperatures around 22-23°C), pleasant hiking weather, and significantly fewer tourists than summer months. Some seasonal businesses may have reduced hours, but core restaurants and attractions remain open.

### Tips
- Bring cash—many shops and smaller restaurants prefer euros
- Pack water shoes for pebble beaches
- Arrive at Piraeus port 1 hour before ferry departure
- Book popular restaurants in advance (Téchnē accepts online reservations)
- Water taxis can reach remote beaches and coves
