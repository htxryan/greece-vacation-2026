# Global Preferences

This group likes to do some of the same things:

- Eating good food, 
- Food tours
- Museums (in moderation, prefer history over art)
- Nature (low intensity, no hikes up mountains, but short walks are ok)
- Good views
- People watching
- Relaxing
- Unique shopping (not luxury shopping)
- no one speaks Greek, some speak Spanish at varying levels, all speak English fluently
