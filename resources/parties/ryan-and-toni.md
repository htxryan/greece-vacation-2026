# Ryan and Toni

- Ryan Henderson, 38
- Toni Haag, 37

## Specific Preferences

- Fine dining (Michelin star restaurants)
- Unique dining (local favorites, holes in the wall)
- Photography and unique photo opportunities
- water (waterfalls, blue water where you can see straight to the bottom) - not necessarily getting in the water (unless you can see to the bottom)
- Toni has an aversion to insects (pretty severe arachnaphobia)
- Toni wants limited museums, but Ryan likes them
- Toni has been to Greece before (Zakynthos, Delphi, Santorini, and Athens) - Zakynthos was her favorite because of the low-key/yogi vibes and pretty blue water, also the locals were really nice - she wouldn't mind going back to any of these spots especially since the others haven't been to Greece before, but she definitely would like to see something new, too
